# Hebnix (Linux)

This is a Linux port of [Hebnix](https://hebnix.com), targeting **Hyprland**
(or another wlroots-based Wayland compositor with `wlr-layer-shell` support).
KDE Plasma/KWin has a best-effort backend for window focus/geometry but has
not been tested against a real Plasma session — see [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

## Installing

### Arch Linux

- Add it as a custom repository to pacman
`echo -e "\n[hebnix-linux]\nSigLevel = Optional TrustAll\nServer = https://repo.xplodingeggo.space/x86_64/" | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.conf`
- then install it whichever way you choose
prebuilt binary: `sudo pacman -S hebnix-linux-bin`
build from source `sudo pacman -S hebnix-linux`
### Other distros

- **AppImage** (recommended) — download the latest `Hebnix-*-x86_64.AppImage`
  from the [releases page](https://github.com/xplodingeggo/hebnix-linux/releases),
  `chmod +x` it, and run it. No install step, works on most distros.
- **Build from source** (developers/advanced users) — see
  [Building from source](#building-from-source) below.

### Development / nightly builds

Bleeding-edge builds from `main` are published as the rolling
[`nightly` prerelease](https://github.com/xplodingeggo/hebnix-linux/releases/tag/nightly)
(tarball + AppImage). These are development builds, not stable releases —
package-manager and stable-AppImage installs are never silently upgraded
onto them.

## Where your data lives

Config, plugins, and themes are stored at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hebnix` (falling back to `~/.config/hebnix` if that's
unset) 


## Workshop LAN multiplayer

LAN multiplayer sets up a virtual network adapter and nftables rules,
which needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN` on the `hebnix` binary. `install.sh` offers to
grant this for you after installing; to do it yourself:

```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_admin+eip ~/.local/bin/hebnix
```

Everything else in the app works fine without it — this only gates LAN
multiplayer.

## Build & install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xplodingeggo/hebnix-linux.git
cd hebnix-linux
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` checks your dependencies, offers to set up hotkey/uinput
access and the Workshop LAN multiplayer permission (both below), then
builds and installs with `make install`. No sudo needed for the build or
install itself — it just drops `hebnix` into `~/.local/bin` along with a
`.desktop` entry and icon.

To do it by hand instead:

```sh
make release   # binary lands at target/release/hebnix-app
make install    # -> ~/.local/bin/hebnix (override with PREFIX=/some/where)
```

Run it with `hebnix` (make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`) or from
your application menu. First run creates an empty `plugins/` folder under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hebnix` (see [Where your data lives](#where-your-data-lives)).
Plugins aren't bundled in this repo — install them from the app's own
Plugins tab, or clone a plugin repo (e.g.
[`rl-profiles-linux`](https://github.com/xplodingeggo/rl-profiles-linux))
into that `plugins/` folder yourself.

## Optional: hotkeys, binds & chat-send plugins

Reading the show/hide hotkey, controller binds, `hebnix.is_bind_pressed`,
etc goes through `/dev/input/event*`, so your user needs to be in the
`input` group:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# log out and back in (or reboot) for it to take effect
```

Plugins that *send* input — `hebnix.input.send`, `hebnix.chat.send`, e.g.
quick-chat plugins — also need a virtual keyboard via `/dev/uinput`. That
device isn't `input`-group-writable by default, so it needs its own kernel
module + udev rule.

AUR installs (`hebnix-linux`/`hebnix-linux-bin`) already ship that module
config and udev rule, so you only need the group step above. Building from
source, `install.sh` offers to set both up for you (needs sudo once). To do
it by hand:

```sh
echo uinput | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf
sudo modprobe uinput
echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"' \
  | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/60-hebnix-uinput.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger /dev/uinput
```

Neither of these is required — without them the app still runs fine,
hotkeys/binds just read as "not pressed" and chat-send plugins can't type
until it's fixed.

## Building from source

### Requirements

- **Rust** (stable), via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- A C compiler (`gcc`/`clang`), for vendored Lua and a couple other native
  deps
- GTK3, Wayland client headers, and an app-indicator library (for the
  system tray icon)

### Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel gtk3 libayatana-appindicator wayland libxkbcommon \
  systemd-libs alsa-lib openssl xdotool libx11 libxtst libxi webkit2gtk-4.1 libsoup3 gtk-layer-shell
```

### Debian / Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libudev-dev libasound2-dev libssl-dev libxdo-dev \
  libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxi-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libsoup-3.0-dev libgtk-layer-shell-dev
```

### Fedora

```sh
sudo dnf install gcc gtk3-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel wayland-devel libxkbcommon-devel \
  systemd-devel alsa-lib-devel openssl-devel libxdo-devel libX11-devel libXtst-devel \
  libXi-devel webkit2gtk4.1-devel libsoup3-devel gtk-layer-shell-devel
```

Don't want to copy-paste package lists? `install.sh` checks all of this
for you and tells you what's missing.



## Controllers
everything will work bro.
As long as it works with evdev it will work.

## Known limitations
- On KDE Plasma, you'll need `kdotool` for some things to work.
- idk much about other DEs/WMs icl but the main problem you will have there (if any) will just be problems with the window not coming to the front or the window not disappearing properly when you press f2 however rest should work as long as you have gtk3 and wayland
